    <div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>I onion, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Season the inside and outside of turkey with kosher salt, focusing on the breast and thighs. Place turkey, breast-side up, in the roasting pan and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate turkey for about 2 days.</li>
            <li>Flip turkey breast-side down, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 1 more day.</li>
            <li>Remove plastic wrap and place turkey on a rack over a baking sheet the night before you plan to roast. Allow turkey to air-dry in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li>ring turkey to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours; pat dry with paper towels. Season turkey with black pepper and place onion and celery in the cavity.            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place turkey, breast-side down, in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until skin is golden, about 30 minutes. Remove turkey from oven and flip to breast-side up. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer turkey to a large platter and loosely tent with aluminum foil; allow turkey to rest about 30 minutes before carving.</li>
        </ol>
